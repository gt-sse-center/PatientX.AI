# Running Mistral-Small Locally for Interaction with Python Script

This guide explains how to get the **Mistral-Small** language model running locally, enabling the usage of the `interact_with_mistral.py` script for summarizing large text datasets from online forums. Mistral-Small is a compact, versatile LLM suitable for summarizing and interpreting text data.

### 1. Environment Setup
Before you can run Mistral-Small locally, make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.

#### Step 1: Install Python
Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```
If it's not installed, you can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Install Mistral-Small Model
To run **Mistral-Small**, you need to install it from a repository or package that hosts LLMs, such as **ollama** or other LLM management tools.

#### Step 1: Install Ollama
To make managing models easier, we will use **Ollama**. Ollama is a local LLM management tool that helps to easily download, manage, and serve language models like **Mistral-Small**.

1. **Install Ollama**: Go to [Ollama's official site](https://ollama.com/) and download the package for your operating system. After installing, verify it with:

   ```bash
   ollama --version
   ```

2. **Download Mistral-Small**: With Ollama installed, use it to download the Mistral-Small model:

   ```bash
   ollama pull mistral-small
   ```

### 3. Run the Model Locally
To run the Mistral-Small model and make it accessible for your Python script:

```bash
ollama run mistral-small
```
This command will start a local server for the model, typically running on `http://127.0.0.1:11434` by default.

### 4. Interacting with Mistral-Small Using Python Script
The Python script `interact_with_mistral.py` is designed to interact with a running Mistral-Small model to process text chunks and generate summaries.

1. **Adjust the URL**: Ensure the script is pointed to the correct URL where Mistral-Small is running locally:

   ```python
   url = 'http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate'
   # or
   url = 'http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/chat'
   ```

2. **Run the Script**: Once the model server is running, execute the Python script to send the text chunks and receive responses:

   ```bash
   python3 interact_with_mistral.py
   ```

### Conclusion
By following this guide, you should be able to successfully run **Mistral-Small** locally and interact with it using the provided Python script. This setup is key to utilizing Mistral-Small's capabilities for generating valuable summaries and insights from large datasets, enhancing the analysis of patient forum posts in the PatientX.AI project.
